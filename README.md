## Getting Started

### Requirements
You need to have Node and a node package manager. We recommend pnpm.

 * Install `Node` 18: https://nodejs.org/en/download
 * Install `pnpm`: https://pnpm.io/installation

### Instructions
Install the dependencies and then run the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.

## Issues
The issues below are sorted in the order of difficulty in our opinion. You can work on them in any order you want.

### Smooth Marquee
> Maximum of 6 points

The marquee animation is having rare glitches. Fix that so that the animation is going to look like a continious scroll forever.

### Anchor Links
> Maximum of 8 points
Make the section links in the navbar and the 5 indicative dots on bottom right clickable.
 * Index 0: The "Challenge" link and first dot goes to the top of the page.
 * Index 1: "Section 1" link and the second dot goes to the white section below the top of the page.
 * Index 2, 3, and 4: The same as above.

### Fix the Navbar
> Maximum of 10 points

Make the navbar stay on the top of the page persistently as the user scrolls down.

### Dynamic Anchor Links
> Maximum of 14 points

Make the titles in the navbar and the indicative dots in bottom right indicate which section the user sees. You can pick any style for the active and passive navbar links. Use the black and white dot versions for the indicative dots.

### Grid Below The Marquee
> Maximum of 18 points

There is a short black bar below the marquee strip. Show the grid background on that section as well so that the marquee strip will look like hovering over a 3D background. The lines of the grid should be consistent below and above the strip.

### Mobile Hamburger Navbar
> Maximum of 20 points

Create a hamburger button for small screen widths that has the section links as a list consistent with the rest of the design.

### Scroll Animation
> Maximum of 24 points

Make the logo in the top section animate in a way you choose as the user scrolls.

## Guidelines
 * You will be evaluated on the quality and quantity of your fixed issues.
 * If you can't fix a task easily, you better work on others. Manage your time wisely.
 * Your submission should work well in screen widths from 375px to 1920px.
 * Your submission will be evaluated manually.
 * You can do it!
